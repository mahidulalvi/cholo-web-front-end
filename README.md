#cholo-web-front-end

CHOLO is a simple idea which came into our mind when we saw lot of people are waiting in lines at a superstore. We thought about it, how much time is being wasted from our daily routine just to get in malls, superstores etc during this pandemic and we thought about utilizing technology to better manage this scenario.

The main purpose of CHOLO is to save people's time spent in the waiting line when entering the stores or any limited indoor space. There will be two parties who will use the application in each scenario. One, the store management and the other will be the customers. The store management will be able to use the application to
get better and accurate information about traffic entering the premises and managing them. And the customers will be able to get useful information for their visit and save time which would be otherwise spent in waiting lines.
